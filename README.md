# VisionAppHackference
Vision App( Photoshop ) is what Arduino is to microcontrollers

Vision app is a GUI based scalable app that facilitates learning and application of image and video processing without knowing any mathematics and writing a single line of code. Vision app allows application of OpenCV filters from 3- 5 minutes to 2 seconds and helps students (even children) learn and apply image processing on the go. Vision app is also a module oriented platform that allows addition of cloud, cryptography and server modules to be added.
