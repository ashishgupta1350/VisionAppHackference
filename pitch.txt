TEAM NAME - PROJECT NAME: Vision - Vision App

**Name of the App**: Vision App (Photoshop++)

**Short Description**: Vision app is a GUI based scalable app that facilitates learning and application of image and video processing without knowing any mathematics, code, reducing time of application from 3-5 minutes to 2-3 seconds with modules running code on camera real time.

## ðŸ”¥  Pitch
**Problems answered:**

The barrier to entry in the field of image processing is very high. For doing image processing, knowledge to python is not enough, rather far for it. You should know Mathematics and 100's of parameters passed to function. Not just that, you need to have solid command over virtual environments, python pip, numpy, matplotlib to draw images. In short, for a non engineer, it is practiacally very hard or infeasable.

A problem that comes with researchers is reaplication of 100's of lines of code to get the correct image processing they want. If you are a researcher who is looking to isolate number plate from image, you need to know Canny Edge detection and 5 parameters that come along. Vision App reduces that to no code.

The problem with children is no familiarity with mathematics and python (advanced). Vision app makes impossible possible. Problem with developers is that they have to know the entire opencv library. So if as a developer, one wants to implement a tensorflow code into the application using opencv, python 3, xlib, matplotlib etc.  Also, you have to vary your code from platform to platform, from Ipython notebook to python in ios to jetbrains in Ubuntu. Vision app simply removes it all.

**Extentions (How it goes beyond Photoshop and Adobe After Effects):**
a) What if you have to apply filters for 100s of images or videos. You can make a video of 100's of images and run filters on videos in real time. One can stop anytime and apply filters on any desired frame as well. All of this happens using parallel processing!

b) Vision app is module oriented, just like android apps extend android, few lines of code and done! You can add any module written in python. We have added 4 modules ( just like apps on Google Play) to this application

c) Cryptography to input entire books into video of few seconds. For every 10 mb of video, one can add 2 mbs of books ( 10-20 books).

d) IP Cam for applying filters from images in real time over a local server using android, Cynogen OS etc.

e) Get code feature allows to get code for applied feature that can copied and run the same code that was applied. The students and even children under 15 years can easily code 100's of lines of complicated code with basic knowledge of python.

f) Game using hand gesture recognition. With one click, one can play Chrome dinosaur game using hands, right on the browser.

g) Vision app is cross platform application. It runs on all the runs on Windows, Linux and Mac Os! The gui is re sizable. The code uses parallel processing and error resilient.

## ðŸ”¦ Any other specific thing you want to highlight?
Some features such as paint application, histrograms, coding, getCode have been understated but they are really powerful.
